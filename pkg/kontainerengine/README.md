## Generated Code

The `types/drivers.pb.go` file is a generated file.  It contains the GRPC 
client and server for the Kontainer-Engine drivers.  This file is generated 
from the `types/drivers.proto` file.  See [here](https://grpc.io/docs/tutorials/basic/go.html)
for more information on the format of these files.

Before running the generation script you must follow the quickstart 
instructions [here](https://grpc.io/docs/quickstart/go.html#prerequisites) and 
install the protoc binary and protoc plugin for Go.

After you have installed the prerequisites, the generated code can be 
generated by running `./scripts/generate-protoc.sh `. This will update the 
`drivers.pb.go` file from the `drivers.proto` template.  This script should 
be re-run every time `drivers.proto` is changed.
